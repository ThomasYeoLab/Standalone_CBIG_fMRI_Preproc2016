This distribution contains the KDTREE, KDTREEIDX and KDRANGEQUERY functions.

Included are the source code files in kdtree/src, as well as precompiled
mex files for the following systems:

  - Mac OS X     (Matlab 6.5)
  - Redhat Linux (Matlab 6.5)
  - Windows      (Matlab 6.1)

Two demo scripts are provided (kdtree_demo.m & kdrange_demo.m).

The new features added June 2004:
	+  You can now use N dimensional data points, where N>3.
	+  Use KDTREEIND to return the index value to the closest point, 
	   instead of the closest point values.
	+  KDRANGEQUERY can now return these index values as well.
