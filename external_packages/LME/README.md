# Linear mixed effects model

This folder contains the external matlab functions related to linear mixed effects models. Specifically, the MATLAB functions implements 2 types of linear mixed effects models (Morphometricity_1RandEffect.m and Morphometricity_NRandEffects.m)

## Mophometricity model

`Morphometricity_1RandEffect.m` was implemented by Tian Ge and Mert R. Sabuncu (Sabuncu et al., 2016) to estimate the trait variance explained by anatomical similarity among subjects.

`Morphometricity_NRandEffects.m` is a version that can estimate the trait variance explained by each of multiple similarity metrics, also implemented by Tian Ge and Mert R. Sabuncu.
