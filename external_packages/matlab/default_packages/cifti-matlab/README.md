MATLAB code for reading and writing CIFTI files
===============================================

This repository contains a subset of the MATLAB code from the FieldTrip and
the SPM toolboxes. It should allow MATLAB users and developers to integrate
the CIFTI file format in their analysis pipelines, using the data and tools
of the Human Connectome Project (HCP).

See http://www.humanconnectome.org for details on the HCP.
