# This script will wait until your job is finished or errored using qstat.
# This script should be run on the headnode. This script should not be used
# independently, instead it should only be called via CBIG_check_job_status.
#
#       -n: Name or ID of your job. If you choose job name, all jobs with 
#               the same name will be checked. If you choose job id, you 
#               can check only one single job.
#               Note that for our current scheduler, the length of the job 
#               name is limited to 15 characters. Longer name will be cut 
#               down. Please be careful.
