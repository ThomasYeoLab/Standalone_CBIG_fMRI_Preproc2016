# Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE)

This folder contains the implmentation of the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) algorithm. Both the emprical (Eickhoff et al., Human Brain Mapping, 2009) and analytical (Eickhoff et al., NeuroImage, 2012) approach to computing the null-distribution of ALE scores are implemented.
