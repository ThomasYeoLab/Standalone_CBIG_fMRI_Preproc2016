# Quality control

## T1 - T2 registration:
	
- View the intra-subject registration cost `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/CBIG_preproc_bbregister_intra_sub_reg.cost`. It is acceptable if the number is lower than 0.5. If it is too large, e.g. 0.7 or 0.8, this subject should be discard.
 
- Visualization check by tkregister2. The user can check the registration by looking at the alignment of the green line and the boundary of grey matter, and also by clicking "compare" to load in anatomical image and compare. The user is able to select different space coordinates to check the alignment in different position. The following three lines are the commands that the user would need. (`REG_stem` is the stem that passed into registration step, i.e. the stem of the image at which step that the user wants to use for registration)

```
cd ${sub_dir}/${subject}/bold/${run_folder}
setenv SUBJECTS_DIR ${anat_d}
tkregister2 --mov ${subject}_bld${run_folder}${REG_stem}.nii.gz --reg init-fsl/${subject}_bld${run_folder}${REG_stem}_reg.dat --surf
```

## Motion correction and motion scrubbing (censoring)

For the parameters and interpolation method used for censoring, please refer to:
Power et al. "Methods to detect, characterize, and remove motion artifact in resting state fMRI." Neuroimage 84 (2014): 320-341.

- Motion outliers text file.

  In this file, each line is a number 0 or 1 corresponding to one frame. 0 represents this frame is censored (removed in analyses). 1 means this frame is uncensored (kept).
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_FDRMS0.2_DVARS50_motion_outliers.txt`

- Motion correction parameters figures.

  Please take a look at the framewise displacement (FD) and DVARS figure to see if too many frames exceed the threshold, which is:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_FDRMS${FD_thres}_DVARS${DVARS_thres}.png`

  Another figure the user can refer to is the correlation between FD and DVARS, to see if these two parameters are consistent:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_DVARS_FDRMS_correlation.png` (correlation between FD and DVARS)
  
  Furthermore, the user can view the MCFLIRT estimated rotation, translation, and mean displacement:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/${subject}_bld${run_folder}${BOLD_stem}_mc_rot_trans_disp.png`
  where ${BOLD_stem} is the filename stem right before motion correction step.

- Motion correction quantitative numbers

  The user can check the absolute/relative mean value of motion: 
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_mc_abs_mean.rms`
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_mc_rel_mean.rms`

- Censoring plots

  In censoring QC step, the voxels are sorted by correlation or fractional difference (both in ascending ordering) between the original signal and the final censored signal. The voxels with ranking 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% are picked up, and three signals of these voxels are plotted, which are: the original signal, the recovered signal (intermediate result), and the combined signal (replace the original signal with the recovered one at "bad" frames). The procedure are repeated both within whole brain mask and grey matter mask. The following are the figures that users can check:

  The three signals of 6 voxels ranked by correlation within grey matter mask:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/censor_interp/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_interp_corr_GM_6plots.jpg`

  The three signals of 6 voxels ranked by fractional difference within grey matter mask:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/censor_interp/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_interp_FracDiff_GM_6plots.jpg`

  The three signals of 6 voxels ranked by correlation within whole brain mask:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/censor_interp/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_interp_corr_whole_6plots.jpg`

  The three signals of 6 voxels ranked by fractional difference within whole brain mask:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/censor_interp/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_interp_FracDiff_whole_6plots.jpg`

- Censoring numerical check

  Some statistics of the correlation and fractional difference described in "Censoring plots" section. The users can check the min, max, mean, and median of the correlation and fractional difference. The text files are:

  Min, max, mean, and median correlation within grey matter mask:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/censor_interp/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_interp_corr_GM.txt`

  Min, max, mean, and median fracitonal difference within grey matter mask:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/censor_interp/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_interp_FracDiff_GM.txt`

  Min, max, mean, and median correlation within whole brain mask:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/censor_interp/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_interp_corr_whole.txt`

  Min, max, mean, and median fractional difference within whole brain mask:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/censor_interp/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_interp_FracDiff_GM.txt`
	
- Censoring correlation and fractional difference volumes

  If the users want to further know the most different regions before and after censoring, they can visualize by:

  Correlation within grey matter mask:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/censor_interp/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_interp_corr_GM.nii.gz`

  Fractional difference within grey matter mask:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/censor_interp/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_interp_FracDiff_GM.nii.gz`

  Correlation within whole brain mask:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/censor_interp/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_interp_corr_whole.nii.gz`

  Fractional difference within whole brain mask:
  `${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/censor_interp/${subject}_bld${run_folder}_interp_FracDiff_GM.nii.gz`
  
## Grey matter signal intensity plots

If you are using our default configuration file, the pipeline will generate a "grey plot" for each run just before any projection from subject-specific space to standard spaces (fsaverage or MNI spaces). The grey plot contains four panels: (1) framewise displacement with its censoring threshold; (2) DVARS with its censoring threshold; (3) global signal of input fMRI volume; (4) signal intensity of all grey matter voxels of the input fMRI volume. You can check the existence of global artifacts by viewing panel 4, and relating the global artifacts to any abnormal spike in framewise displacement and DVARS. This "grey plot" will be stored as:

`${sub_dir}/${subject}/qc/${subject}_bld${run_folder}${BOLD_stem}_greyplot.png`

If you want to check the "grey plot" after different preprocessing steps, you can specify `CBIG_preproc_QC_greyplot -FD_th ${your_FD_threshold} -DV_th ${your_DVARS_threshold}` multiple times in the configuration file (but must be after `CBIG_preproc_bbregister` step because it needs intra-subject registration information to create masks).
	
## Volumetric projection (inter-subject registration):

For checking purpose, our pipeline also projects the subject anatomical image to MNI 1mm space. To check if the volumetric projection (if any) has been done properly, the user can load in the projected anatomical image and the MNI 1mm template together to see if they are aligned. Here is the command:
```
freeview ${sub_dir}/${subject}/vol/norm_MNI152_1mm.nii.gz ${CBIG_CODE_DIR}/data/templates/volume/FSL_MNI152_FS4.5.0/mri/norm.nii.gz
```

## Group-level QC plot:

- QC-RSFC correlation vs ROIs to ROIs distance

  The users can use our function `$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/utilities/CBIG_preproc_plot_QC_RSFC_corr_vs_distance_wrapper.m` to plot the correlation between QC metric and functional connectivity, versus the distance between pairs of ROIs. This plot can be used to determine how much residual motion/respiratory effects on RSFC exists in the data, and its relationship with ROIs to ROIs distance. The users can check the usage of this function in MATLAB command line:
```
addpath([getenv('CBIG_CODE_DIR') '/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/utilities']);
help CBIG_preproc_plot_QC_RSFC_corr_vs_distance_wrapper.m
rmpath([getenv('CBIG_CODE_DIR') '/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/utilities']);
```
  Notice that `$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/utilities/CBIG_preproc_plot_QC_RSFC_corr_vs_distance_wrapper.m` is specific to our preprocessing pipeline because it depends on the assumed folder structures. If the users want to plot this figure for some data not processed by our pipeline, they need to write their own wrappers to read in data and call `$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/utilities/CBIG_plot_QC_RSFC_corr_vs_distance_matrix.m` to do the plotting.
