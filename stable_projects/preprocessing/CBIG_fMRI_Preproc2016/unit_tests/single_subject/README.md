This readme includes the steps about how to run the single subject preprocessing pipeline to check the correctness of code (this check is especially useful for admin when you are releasing some code). Notice that all the filenames and directories below work for CBIG lab only. It is assumed that the input surface data are in `fsaverage5` space.

In this unit tests, there are in total 4 different test cases:

1. Full preprocessing pipeline test (multi-echo acquisition; regression: GSR; spatial distortion correction: magnitude and phase difference image)
2. Motion filtering (See [Respiratory pseudomotion filtering](https://github.com/YeoPrivateLab/CBIG_private/blob/develop/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/respiratory_pseudomotion_filtering.md) README)
3. aCompCor test (regression: aCompCor)
4. spatial distortion correction using opposite phase encoding direction fieldmaps

## Data
- Data set

In this unit test, we are using 3 subjects from 3 datasets. 

For test case **1**, the subject is acquired using a multi-band multi-echo protocol. The raw structural MRI data and raw functional MRI data are in this folder:
`/mnt/isilon/CSC2/Yeolab/Data/MBME`
only the day 1 session 1 data from subject TECH005 is used for test case **1**.

For test case **2** and **4**, the subject is from the Healthy Brain Network (**HBN**).

HBN data contain both structural MRI (T1) and functional MRI (T2*). All subjects (N = 2195) are young subjects (age: 6-22). The preprocessed (by `recon-all`) structural MRI data and raw functional MRI are in this folder:
`/mnt/nas/CSC7/Yeolab/Data/HBN`
where the folder names with `_FS` (e.g. `sub-NDARBF851NH6_FS`) meaning they are structual MRI data after `recon-all` processing, and the folder names without `_FS` (e.g. `sub-NDARBF851NH6`) meaning they are raw functional MRI data.

For test case **3**, the subject is from the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (**GSP**).

GSP data contain both structual MRI (T1) and functional MRI (T2*). All subjects (N = 1570) are healthy, young subjects (age: 18-35). The preprocessed (by `recon-all`) structural MRI data and raw functional MRI are in this folder:
`/mnt/isilon/CSC2/Yeolab/Data/GSP`
where the folder names with `_FS` (e.g. `Sub1116_Ses1_FS`) meaning they are structual MRI data after `recon-all` processing, and the folder names without `_FS` (e.g. `Sub1116_Ses1`) meaning they are raw functional MRI data.

## Code
The users can use the following commands to call each of the 4 test cases:

* Test case 1 (full preprocessing pipeline):

```
$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/unit_tests/single_subject/CBIG_preproc_unit_tests_call_fMRI_preproc.sh <preproc_out_dir>
```

The pipeline will be run with this configuration file

```
$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/unit_tests/single_subject/prepro.config
```

* Test case 2 (motion filtering):

```
$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/unit_tests/single_subject/CBIG_preproc_unit_tests_test_motion_filtering.csh <preproc_out_dir>
```

The pipeline will be run with this configuration file

```
$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/unit_tests/single_subject/prepro_motion_filtering.config
```

* Test case 3 (aCompCor):

```
$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/unit_tests/single_subject/CBIG_preproc_unit_tests_call_fMRI_preproc_aCompCor.csh
```

The pipeline will be run with this configuration file

```
$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/unit_tests/single_subject/prepro_aCompCor.config
```

* Test case 4 (spatial distortion correction opposite phase encoding direction):

```
$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/unit_tests/single_subject/CBIG_preproc_unit_tests_call_fMRI_preproc_sdc_oppo_PED.csh
```

The pipeline will be run with this configuration file

```
$CBIG_CODE_DIRstable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/unit_tests/single_subject/prepro_sdc_oppo_PED.config
```



**Alternatively**, users can run these 4 test cases in one wrapper function as following in MATLAB.

```
runtests('CBIG_preproc_single_subject_unit_test')
```

The estimated wall time and mem usage are ~2.5h and ~6G.

## Results
For test case 1 (full preprocessing pipeline), the users should compare **three** aspects of their results from the ground truth: (1) the time series in fsaverage surface space; (2) the time series in MNI 2mm volumetric space; (3) the functional connectivity matrices

- Compare time series in fsaverage space

In a bash shell, use the following command

```
$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/unit_tests/single_subject/CBIG_preproc_unit_tests_cmp_in_fsaverage5.csh <preproc_out_dir> <file_stem_in_fsaverage5_space> <compare_out_dir>
```

This command will generate the correlation between the time series in your preprocessed NIFTI file and the ground truth time series for each vertex in fsaverage5 space. You can check the histogram of the correlations (named as `<compare_out_dir>/sub005/<run_number>/gt_user-test_corr_surf_hist.png`), as well as the plot of correlations projected on fsaverage5 space (named as `<compare_out_dir>/sub005/<run_number>/gt_user-test_corr_surf.png`).

- Compare time series in MNI 2mm space

In a bash shell, use the following command:

```
$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/unit_tests/single_subject/CBIG_preproc_unit_tests_cmp_in_mni2mm.csh <preproc_out_dir> <final_file_stem_in_MNI_space> <compare_out_dir>
```

This command will generate the correlation between the time series in your preprocessed NIFTI file and the ground truth time series for each grey matter voxel in MNI 2mm space. You can check the histogram of the correlations (named as `<compare_out_dir>/sub005/<run_number>/gt_user-test_corr_vol_gm_hist.png`), as well as visualize the spatial distribution of the correlations in the MNI space (named as `<compare_out_dir>/sub005/<run_number>/gt_user-test_corr_vol_gm.nii.gz`) using freeview.

- Compare functional connectivity matrices

In a Matlab terminal, use the following command:

```
cd(fullfile(getenv('$CBIG_CODE_DIR'), 'stable_projects', 'preprocessing', 'CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016', 'unit_tests', 'single_subject'));
CBIG_preproc_FCmatrices_UnitTestCmp('<preproc_out_dir>', '<test_file_stem>');
```

`preproc_out_dir` should store the directory path where the output data (generated by `CBIG_preproc_unit_tests_call_fMRI_preproc.csh`) is stored. `test_file_stem` is an optional argument. It is a string that is appended to the generated FC matrices filename. For example, a typical FC matrix file name could be `sub005_rest_skip8_stc_mc_sdc_me_residc_interp_FDRMS0.3_DVARS60_bp_0.009_0.08_fs6_sm6_all2all.mat`. In this case, the `test_file_stem` would be `rest_skip8_stc_mc_sdc_me_residc_interp_FDRMS0.3_DVARS60_bp_0.009_0.08_fs6_sm6`. The default `test_file_stem` is `rest_skip8_stc_mc_sdc_me_residc_interp_FDRMS0.3_DVARS60_bp_0.009_0.08_fs6_sm6`.  If you successfully replicated the ground truth functional connectivity matrices, this command will output `"All correlation matrices are the same"`. A text file will named `inequal_corr_log.txt` will also be generated and stored in `preproc_out_dir`. It will display the differences between the user-generated results and the ground truth.

For test case 2 (motion filtering), only the motion parameters are compared with the ground truth, which is stored here: `$CBIG_TESTDATA_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/single_subject/test_motion_filter/sub-NDARBF851NH6/bold/<run_number>/sub-NDARBF851NH6_bld001_rest_skip8_stc_mc.par`

For test case 3 and 4 (aCompCor & spatial distortion correction opposite phase encoding direction), only the final volume is compared with the ground truth. 

Specifically, for test case 3, the volumes that are checked include: `$CBIG_TESTDATA_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/single_subject/aCompCor/Sub1116_Ses1/bold/<run_number>/Sub1116_Ses1_bld<run_number>_rest_skip4_stc_mc_resid.nii.gz` 

For test case 4, the volume that is checked include: `$CBIG_TESTDATA_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/single_subject/data/sub-NDARBF851NH6/bold/<run_number>/sub-NDARBF851NH6_bld001_rest_skip8_stc_mc_sdc.nii.gz`
