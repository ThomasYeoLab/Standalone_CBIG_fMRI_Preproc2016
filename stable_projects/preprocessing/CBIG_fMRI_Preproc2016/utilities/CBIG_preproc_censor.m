% [out_series, interm_out_series, f, cos_coeff, sin_coeff] = CBIG_preproc_censor(in_series, in_sample_time, out_sample_time, oversample_fac, low_f, high_f)
%
% This function estimates lost data point from unevenly sampled input data.
% Users can perform bandpass filtering simultaneously by specifying low_f
% and high_f, where [low_f, high_f] (inclusive) is the passband. If low_f
% and high_f are not passed in, then bandpass filtering will not be
% performed.
%
% This function computes estimated signal interm_out_series (at time
% out_sample_time) from unevenly sampled signal in_series (sampled at time
% in_sample_time) using Lomb-Scarge periodogram spectral analysis technique.
% The length of in_sample_time must be equal to the number of rows of
% in_series. The routine will calculate the coefficients for an increasing
% sequence of frequencies up to the Nyquist frequency, with an oversampling
% factor of loversample_fac (typically >= 4). 
% 
% If low_f and high_f are passed in, the coefficients of the frequencies
% outside the passband are set to be 0. out_series is recovered by the
% masked coefficients.
% 
% If low_f and high_f are not passed in, out_series is the same as
% interm_out_series.
%
% Input:
%     - in_series: 
%       Input signal matrix (treat each column as a channel) with dimension
%       of num_in_time x nChannel, where num_in_time is the number of
%       unevenly sampled time points, nChannel could be number of voxels in
%       fMRI data.
%
%     - in_sample_time: 
%       Nonuniform sampling time sequence with dimension of num_in_time x
%       1. in_series(k) is sampled at time in_sample_time(k), where k is
%       from 1 to num_in_time.
%
%     - out_sample_time: 
%       A vector, recovering time sequence with dimension of num_out_time x
%       1. The recovered signal out_series(k) is sampled at
%       out_sample_time(k), where k is from 1 to num_out_time.
%
%     - oversample_fac: 
%       A scalar, the oversampling factor (typically >= 4). The interval of
%       frequencies is 1/(T*oversample_fac), where T is the whole time
%       interval (T = max(in_sample_time) - min(in_sample_time)). e.g. 8
%
%     - outliers:
%       A num_out_time x 1 binary vector. 0 means low-motion frames; 1
%       means high-motion frames. To be clearer, the indices of 0s
%       correspond to in_sample_time.
%
%     - low_f:
%       A string, low cut-off frequency. The passband includes cut-off
%       frequencies. If the user does not want to perform bandpass
%       filtering, please do not pass in this parameter.
%       e.g. if the passband is [0, 0.08], then low_f is '0'.
%
%     - high_f:
%       A string, high cut-off frequency. The passband includes cut-off
%       frequencies. If the user wants to do highpass filtering, then
%       high_f is 'Inf'. If the user does not want to perform bandpass
%       filtering, please do not pass in this parameter.
%       e.g. if the passband is [0, 0.08], then high_f is '0.08'.
%
% Output:
%     - out_series:
%       Depend on whether bandpass filtering is performed. If bandpass
%       filtering is performed, the coefficients of frequencies outside the
%       passband are set to be 0. And out_series is recovered by the masked
%       coefficients. If bandpass filtering is not performed, out_series is
%       the same as interm_out_series. 
%       It has the dimension of num_out_time x nChannel.
%
%     - interm_out_series: 
%       Recovered signal matrix with dimension of num_out_time x nChannel.
%       The interpolation is done with the coefficients on all frequency
%       components.
%
%     - f: 
%       A num_freq_bin x 1 vector. It is an increasing sequence of
%       frequencies, and num_freq_bin is the number of frequencies in this
%       sequence. It is the frequency sequence that is considered when this
%       function tries to recover the signal.
%
%     - cos_coeff: 
%       A num_freq_bin x 1 x nChannel matrix. It is the coeffients of
%       cos(2*pi*f*in_sample_time - tau) components, where tau is the phase
%       delay defined in Lomb-Scargle periodogram. It is used to recover
%       signal.
%
%     - sin_coeff: 
%       A num_freq_bin x 1 x nChannel matrix. It is the coeffients of
%       sin(2*pi*f*in_sample_time - tau) components, where tau is the phase
%       delay defined in Lomb-Scargle periodogram. It is used to recover
%       signal.
% 
% Example:
% [out_sample_series, f, cos_coeff, sin_coeff] = CBIG_preproc_censor(in_sample_series, in_sample_time, out_sample_time, 8, outliers, 0, 0.08)
