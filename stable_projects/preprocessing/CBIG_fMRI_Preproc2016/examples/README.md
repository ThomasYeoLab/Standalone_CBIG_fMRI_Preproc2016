FMRI preprocessing project depends on real fMRI data, but these data are too large to be released in our GitHub repository. Therefore, we do not provide examples to run the scripts of this project.

However, you can check our `unit_tests` folder for your reference, note that the `unit_tests` example can only run within CBIG lab.
