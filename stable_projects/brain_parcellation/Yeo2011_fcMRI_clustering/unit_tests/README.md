## Unit test: 17 network clustering on 2 subjects

The unit test for Yeo2011_fcMRI_clustering applies the clustering algorithm to the following 2 CoRR_HNU exemplar subjects: `$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Yeo2011_fcMRI_clustering/examples`

Please refer to [example readme](/stable_projects/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Yeo2011_fcMRI_clustering/examples/README.md)

### Note

We also provide the instructions on performing Yeo2011_fcMRI_clustering on 100 subjects preprocessed by [our own pipeline](/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016), which is under: `$CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/preprocessing/CBIG_fMRI_Preproc2016/unit_tests/100subjects_clustering`
